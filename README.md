# mcservercreator
This is a program that creates Minecraft servers for you. It is unfinished so will be slightly buggy and more features will come in the future.
# Antivirus false positives
Many antiviruses flag this as malware, this is a false positive, probably because of how it runs itself and checks for updates. Just allow it though your antivirus as this is non-malicious software and it will not harm your computer in any way.
# Windows protected your PC message
This is because not many people use this program so Windows is warning you, saying it doesn't know how safe it is because there isn't enough data from when people are running it. Press more info and then run anyway.
# Updating your server to a newer version
If you want to update your server to a new version of Minecraft, simply tell the program to create a new server of the version you want but tell it to put the server in the same folder that your current server is in. It will then update the server to the version you chose. After that, you can delete any files with the old version in it's name. For example, if you are updating from 1.15.2 to 1.16, you can delete 1.15.2.jar.
# Compiling
This program requires the boost library and libcurl so make sure you have both of those.
