# mcservercreator
This is a program that creates Minecraft servers for you. It is unfinished so will be slightly buggy and more features will come in the future.

# Updating your server to a newer version
If you want to update your server to a new version of Minecraft, simply tell the program to create a new server of the version you want but tell it to put the server in the same folder that your current server is in. It will then update the server to the version you chose. After that, you can delete any files with the old version in it's name. For example, if you are updating from 1.15.2 to 1.16, you can delete 1.15.2.jar.
